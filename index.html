        <h1>Sweta Gupta</h1>
        <p id="about">As a passionate and dedicated software engineer, I thrive on solving complex problems and building impactful solutions that drive business success. With a strong background in Java and Spring Boot development, I specialize in creating scalable, high-performance applications that are optimized for real-world use. I have experience in developing full-stack web applications, implementing RESTful APIs, and working with databases like MySQL.

            Throughout my career, I have worked on diverse projects, including taxi booking apps, e-commerce platforms, and portfolio applications. Each project has deepened my understanding of software design principles, coding best practices, and the importance of user-centric development. I am particularly interested in developing applications that are multilingual and inclusive, with a strong emphasis on user experience and accessibility.
            
            As a continuous learner, I am constantly improving my skills in data structures, algorithms, and cloud technologies. I believe in the power of collaboration and teamwork and am always looking for new opportunities to work with like-minded professionals who are passionate about technology and innovation.
            
            Beyond coding, I am a keen problem solver and a proponent of continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) to ensure efficient development cycles and faster delivery of high-quality software.</p>
